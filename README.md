# monero-coin-prediction

[Dataset Used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory?select=coin_Monero.csv)

This is my AI coin prediction algorithm. This is the alpha stage, so there will be improvements to come. Soon to be implemented: pipeline to get current data, accuracy improvements and more! (Ideally, better visuals as well)

I use a BayesianLSTM model that I train using the dataset above, that predicts future prices of Monero using market patterns from coin history. Then, the training history is plotted. 

Coins available: Aave, BinanceCoin, Bitcoin, Cardano, ChainLink, Cosmos, CryptocomCoin, Dogecoin, EOS, Ethereum, Iota, Litecoin, Monero, NEM, Polkadot, Solana, Stellar, Tether, Tron, Uniswap, USDCoin, WrappedBitcoin, XRP
