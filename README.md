# ML-coin-prediction, a cryptocurrency prediction neural network by Alexander Nichols

## Tools used in the creation of this project:

> [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory)
 
> PyTorch, Pyro, sklearn

## Summary:

This is my AI coin prediction algorithm. This is the alpha stage, so there will be improvements to come. Soon to be implemented: qccuracy improvements and better visuals

I use a BayesianLSTM model that I train using the dataset above and pipeline-ing in most current data; it predicts future prices of the specified coin using market patterns from coin history. Then, the training history is plotted

Coins available: Aave, BinanceCoin, Bitcoin, Cardano, ChainLink, Cosmos, CryptocomCoin, Dogecoin, EOS, Ethereum, Iota, Litecoin, Monero, NEM, Polkadot, Solana, Stellar, Tether, Tron, Uniswap, USDCoin, WrappedBitcoin, XRP
